# Mobile-Developement-I-Course-Project
Final project for my Mobile Development I course.
Tasked with making any app that included a long list of features, such as a splash page, multiple screens, data passed between screens, user input, etc.
Coded in Android Studio in JAVA.
Unfortuantely, the full program file was too big to upload to GitHub,
so I copied all of the most important and relevant code into text files and uploaded that instead.
I didn't see the need to upload the photos I used cause they are just stock photos of exactly what they are named (ex. "@drawable/white_shirt").
